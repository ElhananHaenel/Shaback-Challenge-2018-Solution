# Shaback Challenge 2018 Solution

**Solution provided by:** Elhanan Haenel

## The Shabak Challenge Adventure

The Shabak challenge began with a seemingly ordinary page displaying the Shabak logo. At first glance, it appeared unremarkable. However, as soon as I hovered the cursor over the logo, it magically transformed into a map.

This unexpected change revealed six marked points on the map. Intrigued, I zoomed into each point, discovering that the shapes formed letters. Together, these letters spelled out "JOINUS," signaling the official start of the challenge.

With excitement, I embarked on the software and data science track.

The first stage presented a ZIP file that required a password to unlock. Knowing this would be a tough nut to crack, I used `Fcrakzip` on `rockyou.txt` wordlist to perform a dictionary attack.

After some effort, I successfully decrypted the ZIP file. Inside, I found two images and a text file. The images seemed unimportant at first glance, but the text file contained Python code. After correcting and running the code, a new image was generated. Upon examining this image, I found a message: "BINARY, START 10,000, - FIBONACCI." Following these instructions, I extracted bits from the second image, starting at position 10,000 and using the Fibonacci sequence. This revealed the message "you got it."

With the correct answer in hand, I advanced to the next stage.

In the second stage, I was given an image file that refused to open normally. I turned to a Hex Editor to dig deeper into the file. The hex values translated into the phrase: "return in base64 sum values below median." Additionally, I noticed a recurring pattern "U05," which represented Hebrew letters. Realizing that I needed to calculate the gematria values (Hebrew numerical values) of these letters, I summed them up, computed the median, and summed the values below the median.

```python
# Python code snippet here...
```

Encoding this result in base64 provided the answer "MjUwMTU3Nw==," allowing me to proceed to the next stage.

We got to the last challenge:

The third stage challenged me to identify suspects based on provided data. After downloading and extracting a CSV file and a `hint.txt` file, I discovered the CSV contained four columns: `Id`, `ip`, `data`, and `url`. The `hint.txt` listed 10 suspect IDs. Analyzing the CSV, I identified patterns in the suspects' behavior. By checking how many IPs each suspect ID interacted with, I pinpointed the 10 users with the highest number of IP interactions. Returning the most frequent IPs used by these suspects, I found the final answer: "41.239.144.6,103.205.114.34,127.95.83.100."

With that, I completed the Shabak challenge. The experience was a thrilling and enjoyable journey into the world of puzzles and code-breaking!
